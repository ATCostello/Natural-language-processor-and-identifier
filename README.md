# Natural language processor and identifier
 A python project which uses machine learning to generate classifications of various spoken languages, and once trained, is able to determine the language of any given text.

## How to use my system
To train the system, place a text file in the training data folder, named as the chosen language. Ensure the text is of sufficient length (at least 5,000 words for accuracy).
Place files which language should be classified in the sample data folder.
Run the application via running bigramLanguageClassification.py.
